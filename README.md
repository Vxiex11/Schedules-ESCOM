# Schedules ESCOM 🏫 Resendiz :)

This is a web-based schedule management system developed as a school project. School project where I made a school page with a different perspective, providing information about the school, careers and so on. Also a login with several cruds, for teachers, subjects, groups, schedules, to be able to have an organization of where to find each teacher where there is also a section for students and to be able to create a user to log in. It allows you to manage:

- Professors 👨‍🏫
- Subjects 📚
- Groups 👥
- Classrooms 🏫
- Class schedules 📅
- Office hours ⏰
- User accounts (admin and student) 🔐
